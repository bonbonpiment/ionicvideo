How to integrate YouTube Videos in Hybrid Apps - Experiment with ionic and PhoneGap 3 on Android

YouTube Videos will be shown in the InAppBrowser (https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/doc/index.md).

In the demo folder you will find another README.md file which belongs to the ionic framework itself. It contains framework specific installation instructions. Prior you may have to install further software depending on your operation system and your target platform. Please refer to http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/.

You can test the code in the demo folder from source by connecting an Android device via USB. Open a command line window with admin rights, change directory to "demo" and type "ionic run android" - see also the guide on http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/testing.html.
